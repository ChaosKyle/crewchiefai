# iRacing AI Crew Chief - Development Checklist

## Overview
This checklist outlines all tasks required to build and deploy the iRacing AI Crew Chief using Grafana, n8n, LLMs, and Kubernetes. Tasks are grouped into key categories to ensure comprehensive coverage.

---

## ✅ 1. Environment Setup
- [ ] Install Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm in WSL
- [ ] Clone the project repository
- [ ] Run the Bash scaffold script to generate the project structure

---

## 🗃️ 2. Directory and Code Organization
- [ ] Verify that the scaffold script created all folders and files
- [ ] Review `ai_agents/` folder for AI agent scripts
- [ ] Ensure `n8n_workflows/` includes real-time and post-race workflows
- [ ] Confirm `k8s-manifests/` and `helm/` contain deployment files

---

## 🚀 3. Deployment
- [ ] Deploy Kubernetes manifests for Grafana, Alloy, Mimir, Loki, Tempo, and n8n
- [ ] Install Helm chart for simplified deployment
- [ ] Access Grafana, n8n, and telemetry services locally

---

## 📡 4. iRacing Integration
- [ ] Capture telemetry using Alloy or another iRacing data source
- [ ] Validate that telemetry data is sent to Mimir, Loki, and Tempo
- [ ] Store sample telemetry data in the `telemetry_data/` folder

---

## 💬 5. LLM Integration
- [ ] Configure API keys for ChatGPT and Claude in `llm_integration.py`
- [ ] Use ChatGPT for real-time feedback and Claude for post-race analysis
- [ ] Implement LLM API calls within AI agent scripts

---

## 🔊 6. Audio Feedback
- [ ] Store pre-recorded audio alerts in the `audio/` folder
- [ ] Enable TTS using `pyttsx3` within `audio_feedback.py`
- [ ] Configure AI agents to trigger audio alerts based on telemetry data

---

## ⚙️ 7. Workflow Automation (n8n)
- [ ] Deploy n8n and access its visual interface
- [ ] Import workflows from the `n8n_workflows/` folder
- [ ] Set up real-time feedback and post-race review workflows
- [ ] Test webhook triggers for receiving telemetry data

---

## 📊 8. Visualization (Grafana)
- [ ] Import dashboards from the `dashboards/` folder
- [ ] Verify that dashboards display real-time telemetry, logs, and traces
- [ ] Create annotations to display AI-generated insights

---

## 🌐 9. Cloud Deployment (Future Phases)
- [ ] Prepare Terraform scripts for AWS, GCP, and Azure
- [ ] Deploy Kubernetes cluster and services in each cloud environment
- [ ] Configure Grafana Cloud integration for telemetry storage and visualization

---

## 🔒 10. Security and Best Practices
- [ ] Enable Kubernetes RBAC for access control
- [ ] Apply network policies to limit pod communication
- [ ] Ensure all containers run with minimal permissions

---

## 📝 11. Documentation
- [ ] Write modular documentation for each folder
- [ ] Include LLM setup, n8n configuration, and audio feedback guides
- [ ] Provide a step-by-step guide for both local and cloud deployment

---

## 🧩 12. Additional Automation Scripts
- [ ] Automate n8n workflow imports using Bash
- [ ] Create scripts to upload Grafana dashboards via API
- [ ] Add a script for setting up LLM API keys securely

---

## 🏁 13. Testing and Final Checks
- [ ] Run a test race and verify real-time audio feedback
- [ ] Check post-race analysis and LLM-generated insights
- [ ] Confirm that AI agents trigger correct alerts and recommendations
